Asynchronous Programming in Node.js
What is Asynchronous programming ?
Real life ex of Sync and Async programming ?
Limitations of Async programming ?
Implementing different  types of async techniques in Nodejs?
What are different ways to implement Async in Nodejs?
What is callback hell ?
Callbacks
Promises
Why are promises used?
Async/Await
Which method is best suited at what scenario ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A company named FoodExpress is building a simple Order Processing System for their food delivery platform.
The system must perform three operations asynchronously:
Fetch order details from a mock database
Process payment
Generate invoice
These operations will be implemented using:
Callbacks
Promises
Async/Await
Each approach is demonstrated using user stories and code.

USER STORY 2 (Promises)
Title: Process payment using Promises
As a backend developer
I want to process an order’s payment using Promises
So that the flow becomes readable and avoids callback hell.
Acceptance Criteria
Function should return a Promise
Must handle both resolve and reject cases
Promise chain should demonstrate .then() and .catch()

Order Retrieval starts with Callbacks
This simulates older Node.js APIs (fs, http, database drivers earlier versions).
Payment Processing is implemented using Promises
Demonstrates modernization and better error management.
Invoice Generation uses Async/Await
Shows clean, synchronous-like asynchronous flow.
