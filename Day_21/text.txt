Steps for implementing simplest middleware ?
Step 1: Create abs express application using const express = require(‘express’).
Step 2: Define a middleware function with parameters req, res and next.
Step 3:  Use app.use()   to register the middleware globally.
Step 4: Log or modify the request object inside the function.
Step 5: Call next() to pass control to the next layer.
Step 6: Add route after middleware so the request flows through it.
Step 7: Run the server and test it.
