The React Context API is a feature that allows data to be shared across the entire component 
tree without having to pass props manually at every 
level. It helps manage global state such as themes, user authentication,
 language preferences, or app configurations.

 Context API solves lot of challenges by:
Providing a global-like store accessible to all components.
Eliminating prop drilling.
Simplifying state management for small-to-medium applications.
In large React applications, data often needs to be accessed by multiple components at different levels in the component tree.
Normally, props have to be passed down manually (“prop drilling”), which becomes cumbersome and error-prone.

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users.
It’s built using standard web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — but behaves like a native mobile app on devices.
PWAs can be installed on a user’s home screen, work offline, and send push notifications — without going through app stores.
Seamless Cross-Platform Experience
Offline Functionality
No App Store Dependencys
 Fast Performance
Engaging User Experience
Cost-Effective Development
Better Discoverability
 Smaller Size & Instant Updates

 Getting started with PWA : 
Step 1: Create a react App 
Step 2: Enable PWA Support 
Step 3: Registering a service worker registration 
Step 4: Adding a manifest file (description file in json format)
Step 5: Running above application and checking for install button

npm install --save-dev workbox-core workbox-precaching workbox-routing // to install pwa 

import * as serviceWorkerRegistration from './serviceWorkerRegistration';
serviceWorkerRegistration.register(); // in index
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

npx create-react-app my-pwa-demo --template cra-template-pwa

This will generate serviceWorkerRegistration.js file

Test PWA Features
Open Chrome DevTools → Application Tab:
Manifest
Shows app name, theme color, icons, and start URL.
Confirms that your app is installable.
Service Worker
Should say “activated and running”
Go offline and refresh — app still works due to caching!
Lighthouse Audit
Go to Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools:
Run a PWA audit
You’ll see scores for “Progressive Web App” compliance (should be green).

Productivity Dashboard Web App"
Project Context
You have been hired as a Frontend Developer to build a Productivity Dashboard Web App for a company that helps users manage their daily goals, tasks, and themes across devices.
The application must use React and demonstrate modern best practices — including Context API, React Hooks, Redux Toolkit, and PWA capabilities — to ensure scalability, maintainability, and offline usability.
 User Stories
Epic 1: Application Setup & Offline Experience (PWA)
User Story 1:
As a user, I should be able to install the web application on my desktop or mobile device, so that I can access it just like a native app.
Acceptance Criteria:
The app should have a valid manifest.json with name, icons, and theme color.
The app should work offline using service workers (default cache strategy).
Users should see an “Install App” prompt.
User Story 2:
As a user, I should be able to open the app even without an internet connection and still view my last saved tasks.
Acceptance Criteria:
Service Worker caches static assets.
Fallback content is displayed when offline.
Optional: Use localStorage or IndexedDB to persist recent tasks.
Epic 2: Theme & User Preference (React Context API)
User Story 3:
As a user, I want to switch between light and dark mode so that I can customize the appearance of the dashboard.
 Acceptance Criteria:
Theme preference (light/dark) should be managed via React Context API.
The theme should persist across all pages.
The toggle button updates theme globally.
User Story 4:
As a user, I want to see my name displayed on the dashboard once I log in, so that I feel my session is personalized.
Acceptance Criteria:
The user data (name, login status) is stored and shared using Context.
Components like Header or Profile can access user data without prop drilling.
